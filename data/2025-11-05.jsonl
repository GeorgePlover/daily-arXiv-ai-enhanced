However, the role of human-like memory within\nthese frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents\ncoordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where\niterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the\nsuccess. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present\nEvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The\nframework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)\nand two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries\nby storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a\nquery, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by\naccumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory\nmodules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip\nplanning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance\nimprovements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success\nunderscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning."}

This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated\nusing a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods.

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes).

To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

As a response to these drawbacks,\nEgalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows\nreplicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader\nallows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of\nany processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any\nprocess to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more\nthan $e = \\lceil\\frac{f+1}{2}\\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently\nsubmitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in\npractical systems.\n  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication\nprotocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously\nspecified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos*\n-- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical\ncontribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously\nproved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the\nwhole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \\ge \\max\\{2e+f-1,\n2f+1\\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal."}

This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated\nusing a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs\nimproved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.\nThese findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for\nreal-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems."}

In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the\ndecomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to\nagents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited\nto the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned\nCooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for\nlearning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks."}

Vincent Poor"], "title": "Federated Attention: A Distributed Paradigm for Collaborative LLM Inference over Edge Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,\ndelivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.\nHowever, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts\nfundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and\ncomputational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and\nreveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and\nadaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver\nscalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments."}
