However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc77\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u4f30\u503c\u8fa9\u62a4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u7ea7LLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b4\u9636\u6bb5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u75285\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u89c1\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u6311\u6218\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u6025\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89e3\u6563\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u8ffd\u6c42\u6839\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u654c\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e95\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseRM\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4eceLLM\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3LLM\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5956\u52b1\u5934\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u597d\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSparseRM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseRM\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale.

Our framework focuses on practicality, demonstrating extensibility beyond wired EEG devices to portable, wireless hardware. A user identification module recognizes the operator and provides a personalized, user-specific service. To achieve seamless, real-time operation, we utilize the lab streaming layer to manage the continuous streaming of live EEG signals to the personalized decoder. This end-to-end pipeline enables a functional real-time application capable of classifying user commands from imagined speech EEG signals, achieving an overall 4-class accuracy of 62.00 % on a wired device and 46.67 % on a portable wireless headset.

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-SAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u9644\u8fd1\u548c\u8fdc\u5904\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-SAM\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u5feb32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge.

Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u63cf\u8ff0\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5176\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u91cd\u6784\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7206\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bdRAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7ba1\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u5c06Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u884c\u4e1a\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed.

However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSTV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5408\u9002\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u503c", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTV\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "STV\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building.

Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters.

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept.

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u80fd\u5927\u81f4\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5951\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u5b66\u601d\u7ef4\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bLLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u5b66\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance.

Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi offer a promising platform for localized, privacy-preserving inference-but remain underexplored in the context of LLM workloads. In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads.

However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.\n  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\\times$ speedups.

Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition.

Traditional approaches rely on continuous monitoring and historical data collection, which becomes impractical in dynamic environments where satellites and mobile devices frequently change operational conditions. Furthermore, existing solutions primarily consider CPU-based computation, failing to capture complex characteristics of GPU-accelerated training that is prevalent across the 3D continuum. This paper introduces ProbSelect, a novel approach utilizing analytical modeling and probabilistic forecasting for client selection on GPU-accelerated devices, without requiring historical data or continuous monitoring. We model client selection within user-defined SLOs. Extensive evaluation across diverse GPU architectures and workloads demonstrates that ProbSelect improves SLO compliance by 13.77% on average while achieving 72.5% computational waste reduction compared to baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProbSelect\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eGPU\u52a0\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u57283D\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8SLO\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u76843D\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u4e91\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u8003\u8651CPU\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349GPU\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684SLO\u5185\u5efa\u6a21\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cProbSelect\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8SLO\u5408\u89c4\u602713.77%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b072.5%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "ProbSelect\u4e3aGPU\u52a0\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u60013D\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002"}}
