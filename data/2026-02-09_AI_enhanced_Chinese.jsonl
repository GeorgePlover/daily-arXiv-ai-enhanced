Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost.

We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage.

This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity.

We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures.

Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%.

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping.

POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks.
