<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统研究向更大更复杂模型发展，作者指出两个潜在问题：故障易发性和性能瓶颈。需要设计能够预防这些威胁的框架。

Method: 提出基于事务的框架来设计复杂多智能体系统，并集成事务调度机制。开发了OptiMA框架实现这些想法。

Result: OptiMA框架能够支持超过100个智能体的复杂系统运行，事务调度带来超过16%的性能提升，并对事务调度问题进行了理论分析。

Conclusion: 事务机制和事务调度是解决复杂多智能体系统可靠性和性能问题的有效方法，OptiMA框架为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

*Yuran Ding,Xinwei Chen,Xiaofan Zhang,Zongwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ASAP是一个多智能体系统，用于自动优化大规模LLM训练性能，通过集成LLM推理与性能分析工具，自动诊断性能瓶颈并推荐优化的分片配置，可实现最高28%的训练时间减少和1.43倍吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法依赖耗时的手动调优或资源密集的黑盒搜索，难以跟上快速发展的LLM领域，导致开发缓慢和资源利用不足。

Method: 设计包含协调器、分析器和提议器的多智能体系统，集成LLM推理、性能分析工具、屋顶线分析和包含专家最佳实践的知识库。

Result: ASAP生成的分片配置可减少28%训练时间，提升1.43倍吞吐量；结合专家优化后吞吐量可进一步提升至2.58倍。

Conclusion: ASAP为大规模LLM训练提供了一个可扩展且可解释的AI辅助性能工程方法。

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow
development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an
Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It
is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable
methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM
training.

### [3] [Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework For Math Problem Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03958)
*Kia Karbasi,Kevin Hong,Mohammad Amin Samadi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种协作多智能体框架，用于数学教育中的自动问题生成，通过推理时计算来更好地控制问题复杂度和认知需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在数学教育自动问题生成中难以精确控制问题复杂度和认知需求，需要更有效的方法来生成高质量的教育内容。

Method: 采用协作多智能体框架，多个智能体迭代优化生成的问题-答案对，以平衡复杂度和认知需求。

Result: 初步评估显示该框架在相关性、重要性、清晰度、难度匹配和可回答性五个元评估标准上提升了生成教育内容的质量。

Conclusion: 协作多智能体工作流程能够产生更受控、更具教学价值的内容，有助于推进自动化教育内容生成和自适应学习环境的发展。

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

### [4] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了NLP分词模型在汇编代码分析中的内在特性，包括词汇量大小、语义覆盖等，并探讨了预处理定制选项和预分词规则对下游任务（如函数签名预测）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汇编代码分析中的分词方法是一个未被充分探索的领域，但其对下游任务性能有重要影响。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估不同分词模型的内在特性及其对汇编代码分析的适用性。

Method: 系统研究各种分词模型，分析其在编码汇编指令和捕捉语义细微差别方面的效率。使用Llama 3.2、BERT和BART等预训练模型，通过内在评估比较分词器的效率、词汇压缩和表示保真度。

Result: 初步发现表明分词器选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果。研究揭示了内在分词器特性与实际汇编代码任务效用之间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究为优化低层代码分析的分词模型提供了有价值的见解，有助于提高基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

### [5] [Large language models replicate and predict human cooperation across experiments in game theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04500)
*Andrea Cera Palatsi,Samuel Martin-Gutierrez,Ana S. Cardenal,Max Pellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，通过系统化提示和探测框架评估LLMs的行为表现。研究发现Llama能高保真复现人类合作模式，而Qwen更接近纳什均衡预测，无需角色提示即可实现群体行为复制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的相似性至关重要，因为不匹配可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复现人类行为会使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统化提示和探测框架，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen），并在原始参数网格之外生成可测试假设。

Result: Llama能高保真复现人类合作模式并捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为，Qwen与纳什均衡预测高度一致，无需角色提示即可实现群体行为复制。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs可以复现群体人类行为模式，并能系统探索未开发的实验空间，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新经验预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BehaviorLens框架系统评估了多模态大语言模型在用户行为推理中的模态权衡，发现图像表示相比文本表示能提升87.5%的下一购买预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本和图像两种用户行为数据表示方式对多模态大语言模型性能的影响，以确定哪种表示方式更有效。

Method: 开发BehaviorLens基准测试框架，在六个MLLMs上测试三种数据表示方式：文本段落、散点图和流程图，使用真实购买序列数据集。

Result: 当数据表示为图像时，MLLMs的下一购买预测准确率相比等效文本表示提高了87.5%，且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: 图像表示在用户行为推理任务中比文本表示更有效，能显著提升MLLMs性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [7] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于协作多智能体规划，通过两阶段协商协议和符号规划避免轨迹级协调的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在部分信息和有限通信下进行联合决策时，轨迹级协调因微小偏差导致冲突的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：智能体先提出候选角色及理由，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配；承诺后各自独立生成和执行符号计划，通过共享世界模型进行执行结果落地。

Result: 在协作推块任务实验中，智能体能够跨情景适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的高层操作，以时间开销换取演化出更高效的协作策略。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

### [8] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能来源的现有解释，证明DKT的优势在于其隐式建模先决关系作为因果结构的能力，而非双向关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，计算教育研究的目标是开发可解释的知识追踪模型。DKT作为传统KT方法的重大进步，其性能提升通常被归因于建模知识组件间双向关系的能力。本文旨在挑战这一主流解释。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAGs)，并在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，验证模型预测能力与因果结构的一致性。同时提出基于DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAGs的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与因果结构高度一致，其学习表示可用于有效提取练习关系DAGs，为模型有效性提供了新的解释。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其近似知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非简单的关联映射，这为理解深度知识追踪模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [9] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言和文化背景下的响应差异，发现提示语言和文化框架会影响模型输出，但无法克服模型对特定国家（荷兰、德国、美国、日本）文化价值的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，研究其是否能够代表多样化用户群体的文化多样性，特别是在训练数据和优化目标存在不平衡的情况下。

Method: 使用来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，以带有和不带有明确文化视角的提示形式测试10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但模型显示出对特定国家文化价值的系统性偏见。明确的文视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：它们对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固着于特定的文化默认值，无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [10] [Detecting Silent Failures in Multi-Agentic AI Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04032)
*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了多智能体AI系统中的异常检测任务，构建了两个包含4,275和894条轨迹的数据集，并比较了监督和半监督方法的性能，最高准确率达到98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI系统具有非确定性和易发生静默故障（如漂移、循环、输出细节缺失）的特点，这些故障难以检测，因此需要开发有效的异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了一个数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变化，并构建了两个基准数据集。在数据集上评估了监督方法（XGBoost）和半监督方法（SVDD）的性能。

Result: 监督方法和半监督方法表现相当，分别达到98%和96%的准确率。这是对多智能体AI系统异常检测的首次系统性研究。

Conclusion: 本研究为多智能体AI系统的异常检测提供了数据集、基准和见解，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

### [11] [Interpreting Multi-Attribute Confounding through Numerical Attributes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04053)
*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型中数值推理错误的表示机制，发现LLMs编码真实世界数值相关性但会系统性放大它们，无关上下文会引发数值表示的一致偏移，揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录了大语言模型中的数值推理错误，但潜在的表示机制仍不清楚。研究者假设数值属性占据共享的潜在子空间，并探究LLMs如何内部整合单个实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示及其下游输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及在不同规模模型上进行基于提示的脆弱性测试。

Result: 结果显示LLMs编码真实世界的数值相关性但倾向于系统性放大它们。此外，无关上下文会在数值表示中引发一致的偏移，其下游影响因模型规模而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体预测编码框架，通过最小化智能体间的互不确定性来解决协调问题，在带宽受限条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中由于部分可观测性和有限带宽导致的空间记忆共享和协调失败问题。

Method: 使用信息瓶颈目标，让智能体学习通信的对象、内容和时机；基于网格细胞般的内部空间编码，发展带宽高效的通信机制和类似海马体社交位置细胞的神经群体；采用分层强化学习策略主动探索以减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，该方法对带宽约束具有卓越的韧性：带宽从128位/步缩减到4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅下降到64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃到28.6%。

Conclusion: 为复杂社交表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论原则和生物学上合理的基础，实现了社交集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop是一个自改进框架，通过迭代策略初始化解决RLVR中的过拟合问题，将标准训练过程转化为探索与利用的良性循环，显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证奖励训练中存在过拟合挑战，模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力，这由策略过专业化和训练期间生成的多样化解决方案的灾难性遗忘驱动。

Method: RLoop框架基于迭代策略初始化，首先使用RL从给定策略探索解决方案空间，然后过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)来优化初始策略，为下一次迭代创建更好的起点。

Result: 实验显示RLoop有效缓解遗忘并显著改善泛化，相比原始RL平均准确率提升9%，pass@32提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过探索与利用的迭代重新初始化，将瞬态策略变化转化为稳健性能增益，是解决RL过拟合问题的有效方法。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

### [15] [Probing the Probes: Methods and Metrics for Concept Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04312)
*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出概念激活向量(CAVs)的传统评估方法存在问题，仅依赖探针分类准确率无法可靠衡量概念对齐度。作者提出基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，并引入三类定量评估指标来检测和缓解概念错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI中，CAVs通常通过训练线性分类器探针来检测可理解概念，但高探针准确率被错误地认为是概念对齐的可靠指标。作者发现探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 引入基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行比较。提出三类定量评估指标：硬准确率、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。分析具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针如何提高概念对齐。

Result: 实验表明故意错位的探针利用虚假相关性也能达到接近标准探针的准确率，证明仅靠准确率不可靠。具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能显著提高概念对齐度。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐的评估指标而非探针准确率，探针设计应同时考虑模型架构和目标概念性质。新提出的方法和指标能有效检测和缓解概念错位问题。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Motivation: 当前LLM安全和鲁棒性研究生态系统存在碎片化、实现错误等问题，导致研究难以重现和比较，阻碍了有意义的进展。

Method: 设计了一个以可重现性、正确性和可扩展性为中心的工具箱，实现了12种对抗攻击算法，集成了7个基准数据集，并通过Hugging Face提供对多种开源LLM的访问。

Result: 该框架包含用于可比性和可重现性的高级功能，如计算资源跟踪、确定性结果和分布评估技术，并与JudgeZoo集成进行评判。

Conclusion: 这些组件共同为LLM安全领域的透明、可比和可重现研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型在临床咨询中用药安全能力的框架，创建了包含6725条禁忌症、28781种药物相互作用和14906个适应症-药物对的RxRisk DB数据库，并构建了2443个高质量咨询场景的RxSafeBench基准。

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的医疗系统在用药安全方面的研究有限，缺乏真实世界数据集，且在真实临床咨询环境中的评估不足。

Method: 提出了一个模拟和评估临床咨询的框架，生成包含用药风险的诊断对话，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业质量，使用结构化多选题评估LLMs在模拟患者情境下推荐安全药物的能力。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs在整合禁忌症和相互作用知识方面存在困难，特别是当风险是隐含而非明确时。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于LLM的系统在确保用药安全方面的关键挑战，为通过更好的提示和任务特定调优提高可靠性提供了见解，RxSafeBench为评估LLMs用药安全提供了首个全面基准。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV)框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控机制来解决前缀主导陷阱问题，将元认知理论转化为计算规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时推理架构缺乏监控过程，导致模型过早承诺次优推理路径且难以恢复，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell以及Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控，捕获元认知体验并利用验证反馈优化监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统性地将基础元认知理论转化为计算规范。

Conclusion: MGV框架为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提出了具体的架构干预建议。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT)方法，通过反复蒸馏低后悔决策轨迹来增强LLM在交互动态环境中的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM原本并非为决策设计，在基础在线决策问题中表现不佳，无法实现低后悔或有效的探索-利用权衡。

Method: 迭代后悔最小化微调：模型每次迭代生成多个决策轨迹，选择k个最低后悔的轨迹，并基于这些轨迹进行自我微调。

Result: Iterative RMFT显著提升了各种模型（从Transformer到开源LLM和GPT-4o mini）的决策性能，能够泛化到不同任务设置。

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT提供了一个原则性的通用后训练框架，可有效增强LLM的决策能力，理论分析表明单层Transformer在此范式下可成为无后悔学习器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [20] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO是一种新的强化学习优化方法，解决了GRPO在部分奖励场景下对失败轨迹错误强化的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解不被正向强化，并在达到质量阈值后转向相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在处理非二元反馈时存在缺陷，当使用序数奖励给予部分学分时，其组平均基线经常对失败轨迹分配正优势并强化错误行为。

Method: 提出CoRPO方法，使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败解决方案永远不会被正向强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线自动过渡到相对偏好模式。

Result: 在代码验证任务上实证验证，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在使LLM通过强化学习学习真正新能力的研究计划中的关键一步，通过让LLM从丰富的多维度反馈中学习，从二元奖励进展到序数奖励。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义性重新定义为协作交互的特征，开发了一个区分可解析的合作查询与不可解析的非合作查询的原则性框架，分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型，并提出了面向表格数据的自然语言界面设计和评估的新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将自然语言查询中的歧义性视为缺陷，本文旨在将其重新定义为协作交互的特征，强调用户和系统共同承担查询规范的责任。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询和非合作查询，并将该框架应用于15个流行的表格问答和分析数据集的查询分析。

Result: 发现现有数据集中的查询类型混合不当，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力，需要重新设计评估方法。

Conclusion: 该框架将视角从消除歧义转向在解析查询中拥抱协作，为表格数据的自然语言界面提供了更明智的设计和评估方向。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于合理代表制(JR)的审核框架，用于评估公民大会等审议过程中专家问答环节的问题代表性，并开发了高效的审核算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者可以向专家提问，但由于时间限制只能选择少量问题。如何选择最能代表所有参与者兴趣的问题集合是一个挑战。

Method: 引入基于合理代表制(JR)的审核框架，开发了在通用效用设置下审核JR的首个算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)。应用该方法比较了主持人选择的问题、整数线性规划选择的问题和大型语言模型生成的问题的代表性。

Result: 研究结果揭示了大型语言模型在支持审议过程中的潜力和当前局限性。通过将方法集成到已在50多个国家使用的在线审议平台，使实践者能够轻松审核和改进未来审议的代表性。

Conclusion: 该框架为审议过程中的问题选择提供了有效的代表性评估工具，有助于提高审议过程的民主性和包容性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，通过将思维链推理形式化为一阶逻辑并验证逻辑有效性，解决LLMs无法可靠验证自身逻辑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能通过思维链进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时，底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了可信度。

Method: VeriCoT从思维链推理中提取形式化逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别支撑论证的前提（源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤），使用自动化求解器验证逻辑有效性。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。

Conclusion: VeriCoT的验证信号可用于推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理的有效性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

Conclusion: OMPILOT为代码翻译领域提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在并行编程方面，通过领域特定的转换器模型和专门的评估指标，显著提升了代码翻译的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

Conclusion: 基于AI的功率管理策略通过预测工作负载需求并优化状态转换，显著提高了边缘计算系统的能源效率。

Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but
introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge
devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic
modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in
Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy
consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling
over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model,
showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity
analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power
efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary
transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest
that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy
efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions.
Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload
distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption
disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing
adaptive power coordination in multi-node environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的并行生成策略，用于MPI应用程序的动态资源管理，通过进程协作生成和重新分配，显著降低了扩展和收缩操作的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MPI应用程序动态资源管理方法存在局限性：要么重新生成整个应用程序成本高昂，要么在收缩时无法完全释放不需要的进程，导致节点无法归还系统。

Method: 提出并行生成策略，所有进程在重新分配前协作生成新进程，同时消除了收缩限制，使并行系统能更好地适应工作负载。

Result: 在保持竞争力的扩展时间（最多1.25倍开销）的同时，实现了快速收缩操作，成本降低至少20倍。该方法已在同构和异构系统上验证，并适用于共享资源环境。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了MPI应用程序动态资源管理中的关键问题，显著降低了重新配置成本，提高了系统适应性和效率。

Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High
Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource
allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload
makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system
utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of
applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although
beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the
reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,
which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.
Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when
shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across
nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.
This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning
strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,
thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage
limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and
reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times
with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations
that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated
on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in
shared-resource environments.

Motivation: 在终端设备上部署大型语言模型面临内存和计算能力限制，而动态稀疏激活特性与主流的分组量化方法存在兼容性问题，需要解决稀疏推理与量化共存的挑战。

Method: 采用zigzag模式量化布局以匹配激活稀疏性并改善GPU内存局部性，设计专用GEMV内核充分利用并行计算单元，开发紧凑运行时机制以最小开销收集稀疏索引。

Result: 在多种模型规模和硬件配置下，该方法实现了最高1.55倍解码吞吐量提升，同时保持与密集量化推理相当的精度。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏性和量化可以在商用GPU上有效共存，为资源受限设备上的高效LLM部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining
importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost.
Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make
efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal
activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,
only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity
could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,
which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained
hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of
techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.
The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes
weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory
locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully
utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that
gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and
hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding
throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,
showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on
commodity GPUs.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers
continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire
system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design
phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a
theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be
abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system.
Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it
introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in
reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting
distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a
shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic
Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component.
Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to
drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze
mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes
crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe
state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the
rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the
behavior of the system under such assumptions.

### [29] [Resolving Conflicts with Grace: Dynamically Concurrent Universality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04631)
*Petr Kuznetsov,Nathan Josia Schrodt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出动态并发概念，仅在当前系统状态下需要与并发操作仲裁时才使用强同步原语，并提出了动态并发通用构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步是分布式计算可扩展性的主要障碍。并发操作在遇到冲突时需要进行同步，而冲突往往只在某些罕见状态下发生。理想情况下，希望能够动态检测冲突，根据当前系统状态调整同步策略。

Method: 定义动态并发概念，即操作仅在当前系统状态下需要与并发操作仲裁时才使用强同步原语。提出动态并发通用构造来实现这一概念。

Result: 提出了动态并发通用构造，能够根据系统状态动态调整同步策略，减少不必要的同步开销。

Conclusion: 动态并发方法能够有效减少分布式计算中的同步开销，通过仅在必要时使用强同步原语来提高系统可扩展性。

Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed
computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization
when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order
in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a
\emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it
is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely
occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic
concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it
\emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system
state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.
