Abstract: The growing volume of scientific simulation data presents a significant challenge for storage and transfer. Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. This study highlights discontinuous DLS as a promising approach for large-scale scientific data compression in high-performance computing environments, providing a robust solution for managing the growing data demands of modern scientific simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained increasing adoption in high-quality image and video generation. As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads. Our experiments demonstrate that StreamFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by an average of $1.35\times$ (up to $1.77\times$).

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately identifying multi-task contention types in high-dimensional system environments and proposes a unified contention classification framework that integrates representation transformation, structural modeling, and a task decoupling mechanism. The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability. The study shows that structured representations and multi-task classification based on high-dimensional metrics can significantly improve contention pattern recognition and offer a reliable technical approach for performance management in complex computing environments.

Abstract: Enterprise LLM deployment faces a critical scalability challenge: organizations must optimize models systematically to scale AI initiatives within constrained compute budgets, yet the specialized expertise required for manual optimization remains a niche and scarce skillset. This challenge is particularly evident in managing GPU utilization across heterogeneous infrastructure while enabling teams with diverse workloads and limited LLM optimization experience to deploy models efficiently.
  We present OptiKIT, a distributed LLM optimization framework that democratizes model compression and tuning by automating complex optimization workflows for non-expert teams. OptiKIT provides dynamic resource allocation, staged pipeline execution with automatic cleanup, and seamless enterprise integration.
  In production, it delivers more than 2x GPU throughput improvement while empowering application teams to achieve consistent performance improvements without deep LLM optimization expertise. We share both the platform design and key engineering insights into resource allocation algorithms, pipeline orchestration, and integration patterns that enable large-scale, production-grade democratization of model optimization. Finally, we open-source the system to enable external contributions and broader reproducibility.

Abstract: The convergence of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the emergence of increasingly complex parallel applications and workloads. These workloads often combine multiple parallel runtimes within the same application or across co-located jobs, creating scheduling demands that place significant stress on traditional OS schedulers. When oversubscribed (there are more ready threads than cores), OS schedulers rely on periodic preemptions to multiplex cores, often introducing interference that may degrade performance. In this paper, we present: (1) The User-space Scheduling Framework (USF), a novel seamless process scheduling framework completely implemented in user-space. USF enables users to implement their own process scheduling algorithms without requiring special permissions. We evaluate USF with its default cooperative policy, (2) SCHED_COOP, designed to reduce interference by switching threads only upon blocking. This approach mitigates well-known issues such as Lock-Holder Preemption (LHP), Lock-Waiter Preemption (LWP), and scalability collapse. We implement USF and SCHED_COOP by extending the GNU C library with the nOS-V runtime, enabling seamless coordination across multiple runtimes (e.g., OpenMP) without requiring invasive application changes. Evaluations show gains up to 2.4x in oversubscribed multi-process scenarios, including nested BLAS workloads, multi-process PyTorch inference with LLaMA-3, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Abstract: Fog and edge computing require adaptive control schemes that can handle partial observability, severe latency requirements, and dynamically changing workloads. Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Communication has become a first-order bottleneck in large-cale GPU workloads, and existing distributed compilers address it mainly by overlapping whole compute and communication kernels at the stream level. This coarse granularity incurs extra kernel launches, forces device-wide synchronizations at kernel boundaries, and leaves substantial slack when the slowest tile or kernel stretches the communication tail. We present AutoOverlap, a compiler and runtime that enables automatic fine-grained overlap inside a single fused kernel. AutoOverlap introduces a communication chunk abstraction that decouples communication granularity from kernel structure and backend mechanisms, allowing chunk-level plans to be ported from existing distributed compilers, written directly by users, or instantiated from reusable templates. Given a local Triton kernel and a chunk schedule, AutoOverlap performs transformations to align computation with chunk availability. Implemented as a source-to-source compiler on Triton, AutoOverlap delivers an average end-to-end speedup of 1.3$\times$ and up to 4.7$\times$ on multi-GPU workloads.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled high-quality creative production across diverse domains, yet existing systems face critical inefficiencies in throughput, resource utilization, and scalability under concurrent workloads. This paper introduces OnePiece, a large-scale distributed inference system with RDMA optimized for multi-stage AIGC workflows. By decomposing pipelines into fine-grained microservices and leveraging one-sided RDMA communication, OnePiece significantly reduces inter-node latency and CPU overhead while improving GPU utilization. The system incorporates a novel double-ring buffer design to resolve deadlocks in RDMA-aware memory access without CPU involvement. Additionally, a dynamic Node Manager allocates resources elastically across workflow stages in response to real-time load. Experimental results demonstrate that OnePiece reduces GPU resource consumption by 16x in Wan2.1 image-to-video generation compared to monolithic inference pipelines, offering a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient solution for production AIGC environments.

Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant progress in the past few years but have only been loosely inter-connected. Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle autonomous driving couples strategic interaction with hybrid (discrete-continuous) maneuver planning under shared safety constraints. We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.

Abstract: Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.
