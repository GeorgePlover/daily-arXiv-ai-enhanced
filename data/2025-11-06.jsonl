We present ALAS,\na stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from\nnon-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks\nand restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in\nprogress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh,\nbounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The\nrepair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies\n(retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards)\ndefined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo\nWorkflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical\nbenchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent\nbaselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running\n1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows\nthat the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and\nthat localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius\nand less makespan degradation than global recompute.

This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation.

In such\nsetting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,\nformalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it\nwill get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the\noriginal informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results\nreveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA\nmodels in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA\naccuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving\nliterature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion\nof this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for\nmore than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the\nerrors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,\nand present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements\nand proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to\nthe best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the\noriginal miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the\nautoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a\nhigher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the\nfield of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success\nmodes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV\ndemonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,\nthese techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using\nframeworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static\ngraphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it\ndifficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention\nalgorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such\ntechniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well\nunderstood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this\npaper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be\ndeployed at scale.

The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific\ntasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic\ndesign automation problem} (EDA).

At the input level, the framework\nemploys a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a\nfine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused\nAttention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling\nof user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario\nadaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%.

To address this,\nwe formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework\nthat integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces\nspecialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine\ndesign candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio.

We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from\nminimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality\nScale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine\nother psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs\ncan precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from\nminimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a\npowerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their\nemergent reasoning capabilities."}
